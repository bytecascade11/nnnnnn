      ByteCascade started as notebook scribbles about battery physics, camera sensors, and how phones <em>actually</em> perform in Nigerian conditions: power outages, dusty roads, prepaid data, and real repair costs.

      Today it’s a trusted source for thousands who want tech advice that respects their reality — not just global launch hype.
