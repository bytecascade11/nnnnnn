# Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra: Early Rumors Heating Up (December 2025)

The Galaxy S25 Ultra drops next week (January 22 Unpacked), but Samsung's already cooking the S26 Ultra for early 2026. Leaks are sparse this far out, but they're promising evolutionary upgrades over the S25 – think better endurance and zoom without reinventing the wheel. Here's the scoop from reliable sources like Ice Universe and Chinese tipsters.

### Design & Build
- Slightly curved edges for even better ergonomics (less angular than S25's rounded titanium frame)  
- Raised rear camera bump for a more "pro" camera vibe  
- Colors teased: Black, gray, silver-blue, and a potential iPhone 17 Pro-inspired purple tint  
- Size: Similar to S25 Ultra (6.8-inch display), but rumors hint at a slimmer profile (~8.2mm thick, ~219g)

### Camera
- Main 200MP sensor carries over, but the **3x telephoto gets a 12MP upgrade** (from 10MP) for sharper portraits  
- Potential return of variable aperture (seen on S10) for low-light magic  
- Major telephoto push across the S26 lineup – expect 5x periscope staying at 50MP, but with AI enhancements for video  
- Selfie cam might add stabilization to fight shaky videos (inspired by iPhone's tremor reduction)

### Performance
- Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 (or Exynos equivalent) – 20-30% faster than S25's Elite chip  
- RAM: 12GB base, up to 16GB for power users  
- One UI 8.5 with deeper Galaxy AI 3.0 (e.g., better sketch-to-image and auto-zoom on selfies)

### Battery & Charging
- **Big win**: 5,200mAh battery (up from S25's 5,000mAh) for longer video playback (~35 hours)  
- Wired charging jumps to **60W** (from 45W) – full charge in ~30 minutes  
- Wireless hits 25W (up from 15W) + Qi2 support for MagSafe-like accessories

### Price & Launch
- Expected: $1,299 starting (same as S25 Ultra)  
- Reveal: Late January 2026 (earlier than usual February slot)  
- Release: Mid-February 2026  

Samsung's playing it safe post-S25, but that battery bump could make the S26 Ultra a day-long beast. With S25's launch imminent, will the S26 need bolder changes to compete with iPhone 17 Pro rumors? Drop your takes below – battery upgrade or bust?
