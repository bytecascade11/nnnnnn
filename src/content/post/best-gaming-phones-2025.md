# Best Gaming Phones 2025 (PUBG, Genshin & CODM) — Global Thermal Stress Test

My name is **@NaijaFragLord**, and I have a serious problem: I game like it’s my full-time job.

In 2025 alone I have:

- Fried two Galaxy S24 Ultras doing 8-hour Conqueror pushes  
- Sold kidneys (okay, just my PS5 Pro) to fund this madness — over **₦8 million** spent  
- Tested every single "gaming phone" on **Lagos 4G/5G**, **inside danfo buses**, **under 40°C heat**, and even during **NEPA blackout on power bank**

## Why This Review Matters (Global Audience)

Most reviewers test phones in normal weather with AC blowing their hair like K-Pop idols.

Not here.

🇳🇬 Nigeria heat + mobile gaming pushes phones harder than any PC benchmarking room.  
If a phone **survives Lagos**, it will **dominate anywhere in the world.**

This is the most **honest, brutal, expensive, and real-world gaming phone test of 2025.**
